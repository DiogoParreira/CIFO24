# CIFO24

1) Individual will have multiple properties:
- initial_board - the starting board state as a list of lists
- board - the current board state as a list of lists
- swappable_positions - a mask that shows swappable positions
- representation - list with only changeable elements as a long list, the one that we will use for crossovers and mutations

So every step of population evolution we will update representation and board afterwards
